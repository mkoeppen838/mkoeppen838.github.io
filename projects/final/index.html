<h2> When the Lights Go Out</h2>
<h5> D.C. live music venues await federal funding necessary to survive</h5>

<div class="text">
<p> Amid a nationwide rise in COVID cases, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a
    stay-at-home order for residents on March 30, forcing live music venues to shut their doors.</p>
   
<p> Unknowingly for some venues, they would be shutting their doors for the last time.</p>

<p>Now, ninth months into the pandemic, D.C. grieves the loss of cultural landmarks: U Street
    Music Hall, Twins Jazz and Eighteenth Street Lounge, after piling bills forced the venues to
    shutter permanently in the last three months.</p>

<br>

<h3> A Glimmer of Hope</h3>

<br>
    
<p>For venues like Pearl Street Warehouse in Southwest, who were fortunate enough to have
    survived the summer, the situation is dire.</p>

    <p> One of D.C.’s newer music venues, Pearl Street Warehouse brands itself as Washington D.C.’s
    “all American live music destination." </p>

    <p>The young venue celebrated its third anniversary last month and had amassed a significant
    following as one of D.C.'s premier small music venues in the past year.</p>


<p>“Now we are basically a bar with [a] limited menu, trying to provide jobs for a few employees,”
says Nicholas Fontana, 57, an owner and managing partner of the venue.</p>

<p>In September, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the <a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-announces-phase-two-live-entertainment-pilot">Phase 2 Live Entertainment Pilot</a>,
allowing six venues, including Pearl Street, to host live shows in the District for the first time
since March.</p>

<p>The program required all participating venues to cap indoor capacity at 50 people, including all
attendees, performers and staff.</p>


<p> Under this requirement, Pearl Street had 36 seats left to make a profit off of.</p>

<br>

<p>“The pilot program does not give us enough capacity to make it viable,” says Fontana of his
venue that usually holds between 150 and 300 people (depending on whether it’s seated or
standing).</p>

<p>Other requirements for participating venues included reserved seating for individuals and
groups of no more than six at socially distanced tables and seats located at least 30 feet from
the stage if there is live singing.</p>


<p>This is a five-foot difference for a venue that promises its customers that “you’re never more
than 25 feet from musical genius” on its website.</p>

<br>
<p>While the program brought some temporary relief to venues, Fontana believes it is going to take
a lot more than pilot programs for venues to survive the next six months.</p>

<p>“We need for the pandemic to ease and the vaccine to get distributed. We also need another
stimulus or local government monies,” says Fontana.</p>

<p>“Until then, it is a survival game to see who will be one of the few live music venues [left]
standing.”</p>

<p>City Winery, GALA Hispanic Theatre, the Kennedy Center, The Hamilton and Union Stage also
participated in the pilot program.</p>

<br>
<h3>"First to close, last to reopen"</h3>
<br>

<p>Pearl Street's story is part of a national trend of venues with mounting overhead costs and zero
revenue intake, struggling to meet ends meet during a pandemic with no clear end in sight.</p>

<p>Without federal funding, 90% of independent venues report they will close permanently in a few
months, according to a recent survey of National Independent Venue Association (NIVA)
members.</p>

<p>Curtis Monroe, general manager of Warehouse Live in Houston, Texas, serves as NIVA’s
“Reopening” task force chair.</p>

<p>Monroe’s venue had expected a “big year” with at least a 15% increase in revenue projected.</p>

<p>Today, the venue is operating at 85% less revenue than in 2019 while still trying to support
furloughed hourly employees and gig workers.</p>

<p>“We have been closed much longer than previous assistance programs could financially support
us. Unfortunately, our federal government has abandoned the industry in delaying relief
packages which could help us survive through this,” says Monroe.</p>

<p>The industry's saving grace, Monroe believes, rests in Congress passing the  Save Our Stages
Act.</p>

<br>
<h3> Save Our Stages Act</h3>
<br>

<p>Introduced to the Senate in July, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4258">Save Our Stages Act</a>, backed by NIVA, would “authorize
the Small Business Administration to make grants to eligible live venue operators, producers,
promoters, or talent representatives to address the economic effects” of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Eligible recipients of the grant can use the funding for any costs incurred from the beginning of
March through the end of 2021. Venues will be eligible for a second grant equal to 50% of the
initial grant if they are still operating at 80% or greater revenue loss come December 1.</p>

<p>Since July, the bill has received widespread bipartisan support with more than 196 cosponsors
and was included in the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6800">Heroe’s Act</a> a passed by the House in October, according to NIVA’s
“Save Our Stages” website.</p>

<p>Over 600 artists have also voiced their support for the bill, including names like Billie Eilish, Neil
Young, Coldplay and Billy Joel.</p>

<p>Currently, the bill awaits approval in Senate with no clear timeline for its passage insight.
For thousands of independent venues on the brink of closure, the waiting game could prove
fatal.</p>

<p>“Every day that Congress fails to act, our furloughed employees, for whom there is no work,
suffer,” NIVA wrote in an October statement after the act logged its 200th cosponsor.</p>
