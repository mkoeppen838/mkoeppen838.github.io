<h5> <b>Hyattsville Life & Times</b> | 13 May 2019</h5>
<p>In an effort to improve the city’s count in the upcoming 2020 census, on March 18, the mayor and the city council proposed and voted unanimously in favor of the creation of a Complete Count Committee (CCC). 
    According to Mayor Candace Hollingsworth and city council documents, the goal of a CCC is to work alongside community members to both encourage and promote responses to the 2020 census.

<p> 
    From cars, to bikes, to the campus shuttle and everything between, when it comes to transportation, there is no shortage of options for students to get around campus. 
    Following a growing trend across major cities and universities, the University of Maryland, in partnership with the city of College Park, is looking to add a new scooter sharing program to that list.

    <h5> <b>Hyattsville Life & Times</b> | 19 April 2019</h5>
    <p>
        AARP State Director Hank Greenberg presented a plaque to Mayor Candace Hollingsworth recognizing Hyattsville as an Age-Friendly Community at a recent city council meeting.

        Hyattsville is the first city in the state of Maryland to receive this recognition and one of 350 communities nationwide devoted to “encourag[ing] active aging by optimizing opportunities for health, participation, and security in order to enhance the quality of life as people age,” according to the World Health Organization.

        <p>
            Nestled amongst the hustle and bustle of downtown Rockville and tucked away next to the ever-so-popular Kung Fu Tea, is a little taste of Paris one might not expect to find in your typical American strip mall.
             Opened in November 2015, Lavande Patisserie prides itself in being “your home away from home” as a local artisan coffee shop combining sophistication and quality in everything from the food to the decor.

            We often dream of what we would do if we were to one day win the lottery.

            For one Gaithersburg man, that dream became a reality this past Independence Day weekend when the Multi-Match subscription holder claimed the game’s $500,000 jackpot.
